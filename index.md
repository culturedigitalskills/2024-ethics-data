This resource aims to introduce the main aspects of data ethics in the cultural heritage domain. It also examines how data management can be supported to become more ethical, while also addressing topical discourse about data ethics in the sector. The resource also aims to support in critically reflecting on some case studies with evident digital data ethics considerations.

- Examine information documenting actual visual digital data in repositories and contrast it with ethical considerations.
- Critically assess ethical implications arising from cases in the digital heritage domain, suggesting how this could affect the discourse around ethics.
