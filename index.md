This session aims to introduce the main aspects of data ethics in the cultural heritage domain. It also examines how data management can be supported to become more ethical, while also addressing topical discourse about data ethics in the sector. As part of the session, we will also critically reflect on some case studies with evident digital data ethics considerations.
 
By the end of this session you are expected to be able to:
 
- Identify and provide examples of some ethical considerations that arise in the context of your research.
- Examine information documenting actual visual digital data in repositories and contrast it with ethical considerations.
- Critically assess ethical implications arising from cases in the digital heritage domain, suggesting how this could affect the discourse around ethics.
