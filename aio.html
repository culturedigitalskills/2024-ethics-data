<p>Collecting digital data, including 3D data, for the documentation,
preservation, study and dissemination of material culture knowledge has
been rapidly evolving in the last decades. Such data provide valuable
insights about the objects’ biographies and the development of humans
within different societal contexts.</p>

</figure><p>With the democratisation of technologies and hence the facilitation
of access to equipment, software and sharing of digital data
information, digital practices have become established in several
domains which aim to investigate human presence and activity, including
archaeology, history, ethnography, art and museum studies.</p>
<p>Yet the speed with which technology progresses, the abundance of
digital data – often called big data – and the lack of standardisation
with regard to digital practices and hence strategies and policies in
the digital humanities spectrum, eventfully raise a range of
considerations many of which pertain to the realm of ethics. This
becomes more prominent, given the possibility to distribute data over
the web, customise data and reuse them for various purposes ranging from
study to creative activities, as well as physically replicating or
reproducing heritage assets through fabrication technologies, such as 3D
printing.</p>
<p>As such, ethics become involved in many aspects of the cultural
heritage digital data domain. Some of the ethical considerations that
might arise when working with cultural heritage data include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do we have the approval of material knowledge and object holders
to digitise assets?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the most appropriate methods to use for digitisation in
the given context of our research?</p></li>
<li><p>How much data do we need and how will we store it?</p></li>
<li><p>Where will we store data and who will we ensure their longevity
and preservation?</p></li>
<li><p>Who will have access to our data?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the secondary uses that we envisage our data will
have?</p></li>

<p>Data ethics refers to the moral principles and guidelines that guide
the collection, storage, use, and sharing of data. Data ethics aim to
ensure that data-related practices and technologies are used in a
responsible and ethical manner, taking into account the potential impact
on individuals, society, and the environment. It involves making ethical
decisions about how data is collected, processed, and used, as well as
addressing issues of bias, discrimination, and inequality that may arise
in data-driven activities. All these are incorporated in the main
digital data ethical considerations, as described below.</p>

<p><code>Ensuring that individuals associated with cultural heritage data are informed about how their data will be used and obtaining their consent for its collection and usage.</code></p>
<p>In the domain of cultural heritage data, privacy and consent are
crucial considerations to ensure the ethical treatment of individuals
associated with the data. This involves informing individuals about how
their data will be used and obtaining their explicit consent for its
collection and usage. For example, when digitising human remains or
artefacts with identifiable features, researchers should obtain consent
from relevant stakeholders, such as descendant communities or cultural
representatives, before proceeding with digitisation efforts.
Additionally, individuals should be informed about the purposes of
digitisation, how the data will be stored, and who will have access to
it. Consent processes should be transparent, ensuring that individuals
understand the implications of providing their data and have the
opportunity to withdraw consent if desired.</p>

<p>Cultural sensitivity is paramount when dealing with cultural heritage
data to avoid actions that may offend or disrespect cultural values or
beliefs. Researchers and practitioners should approach the digitisation,
analysis and interpretation of cultural artefacts, including endangered
knowledge witnesses and human remains, with respect for the cultural
significance they hold. This includes consulting with relevant cultural
communities or stakeholders to understand their perspectives and
preferences regarding the handling of cultural heritage data.
Additionally, researchers should be mindful of cultural protocols,
traditions, and sensitivities when sharing or disseminating digitised
data, ensuring that they are represented accurately and
respectfully.</p>

<p><code>Being transparent about the sources of cultural heritage data, the methods used for its collection and analysis, and being accountable for any decisions or actions taken based on the data.</code></p>
<p>Transparency and standardisation are fundamental principles in the
ethical treatment of cultural heritage data. Researchers should be
transparent about the sources of data, the methods used for its
collection and analysis, and any decisions or actions taken based on the
data. This transparency fosters accountability and trust among
stakeholders, ensuring that digitisation efforts are conducted ethically
and responsibly. Additionally, standardising digitisation and data
management practices enables consistency, reproducibility, and
comparability across studies, facilitating collaboration and data
sharing within the research community. Standardisation in the 3D data
heritage domain is still a challenging topic and the digital humanities
community is undertaking efforts towards this domain.</p>
<p>Yet, there is still a need to reach a consensus, and such efforts
should be supported by adequate infrastructure as well as endeavours to
enhance the digital skills capacity of humanities researchers who
acquire, deploy, analyse, and share data for research and dissemination
purposes.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p><code>Ethical behaviour requires assessing and minimising errors in digital data, including those introduced during digitisation and reconstruction processes, to ensure the reliability of results.</code></p>
<p>Ensuring the reliability of cultural heritage data is essential to
uphold ethical standards in research and practice. Researchers should
assess and minimise errors in digitised data, including those introduced
during digitisation and reconstruction processes. This involves
validating reconstructed data through quality control measures. Quality
control measures refer to the following data quality dimensions
(Government Data Quality Hub, 2021):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Ensure data reflects reality, with
correct and up-to-date values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Completeness</strong>: Have all necessary data available
for a specific purpose, minimising critical omissions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uniqueness</strong>: Eliminate duplicates to maintain
data integrity and trustworthiness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Ensure data values are coherent
within records and across datasets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeliness</strong>: Ensure data is available when
needed, especially in time-sensitive contexts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Validity</strong>: Confirm data adheres to expected
formats, types, and ranges, facilitating effective use and
automation.</p></li>

<p>Promoting equity and accessibility is crucial to ensure that cultural
heritage data is accessible to all stakeholders, including marginalised
or underrepresented communities. Researchers should actively address
barriers to access, such as language barriers, technological
limitations, or lack of resources, to ensure that diverse
interpretations and voices are represented in digitisation and data
sharing efforts. Participatory approaches can assist towards this
direction. Within this frame, researchers should prioritise inclusivity

<p><code>Taking measures to preserve cultural heritage data for future generations, including considerations for long-term storage, maintenance, and accessibility.</code></p>
<p>Preserving cultural heritage data for future generations is a
responsibility that requires careful consideration of long-term storage,
maintenance, and accessibility. Researchers should implement strategies
for data preservation, including robust backup and archival systems, to
safeguard digitised data from loss or degradation over time.
Additionally, researchers should document metadata and paradata to
facilitate data discovery and interpretation by future researchers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Metadata can be described as data about data, e.g. information about
an object in a museum collection which might be visualised through a 3D
digital model in a Digital Asset Management System (DAMS)</p>
<p>Paradata can be described as data about processes, e.g. information
about the digitisation and post-processing of the 3D model.</p>

<p>A great amount of data managed by digital humanists in research and
practice include information about people. It is important to remember
that within ethical conduct, personal data should be protected and hence
comply with national and international regulations.</p>
<p>In the UK, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection" class="external-link">Data
Protection Act (DPA)</a> is legislation that governs the processing of
personal data. It provides guidelines and regulations on how personal
data should be collected, stored, used, and shared. The DPA outlines the
rights of individuals regarding their personal data and imposes
obligations on organisations that handle such data to ensure its
protection. The DPA is essentially the UK’s implementation of the
European GDPR.</p>
<p>According to the DPA, personal data should be (Data Protection Act
2018):</p>
<ul>
<li>used fairly, lawfully and transparently - used for specified,
explicit purposes</li>
<li>used in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to only what is
necessary</li>
<li>accurate and, where necessary, kept up-to-date</li>
<li>kept for no longer than is necessary</li>
<li>handled in a way that ensures appropriate security, including
protection against unlawful or unauthorised processing, access, loss,
destruction or damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within this frame, it is particularly necessary to protect sensitive
data, which refer to: race; ethnic background; political opinions;
religious beliefs; trade union membership; genetics; biometrics; health;
sex life or orientation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" class="external-link">General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR)</a> is a comprehensive data protection law enacted by the
European Union (EU) in 2018. The GDPR harmonises data protection laws
across all EU member states. It enhances the rights of individuals and
imposes stricter obligations on organisations regarding the processing
of personal data. These are the main protection and accountability
principles according to the GDPR (GDPR 2016):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency: These principles must
guide the processing of data.</p></li>
<li><p>Purpose limitation: Data should be used only for the purposes
specified to the data subject when their data was collected.</p></li>
<li><p>Data minimization: Only the necessary data should be collected
and processed for the specified purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>Accuracy: Personal data should be accurate and kept
up-to-date.</p></li>
<li><p>Storage limitation: Personal data can be stored only for the time
that is necessary for the specified purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrity and confidentiality: Data processing must ensure the
security, integrity, and confidentiality of the data.</p></li>

<p>The previous sections discussed the definition of ethics and
presented the main considerations that researchers and practitioners
should have in mind when dealing with digital data in the heritage
domain. All the considerations mentioned about ethics should be taken
into account throughout the digital data lifecycle.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/ColorfulProcessPieChart.png" alt="cycle" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The data lifecycle © by the 3D Service Suite,
University of Brighton under CC BY 4.0</div>
</figure><p>For instance, when <strong>planning data collection</strong>,
considerations such as <strong>ownership of data</strong> and
<strong>cultural sensitivities</strong> must be addressed. Who are the
owners or creators of the objects and practices we want to digitise and
collect data about? Should we consider cultural sensitivities and
potential issues that may arise from collecting such data? Are there
biases involved in selecting these objects and associated data? Are our
data sufficiently representative?</p>
<p>During <strong>data collection</strong>, it’s essential to adhere to
best practices and <strong>standards</strong> governing our processes
and workflows. Moreover, obtaining full <strong>consent</strong> for
data collection, maintaining <strong>transparency</strong> about our
practices, <strong>securing</strong> data, and ensuring the
<strong>reliability</strong> of the digitisation and data collection
process are crucial.</p>
<p>Therefore, Privacy and Consent, Cultural Sensitivity, Ownership and
Intellectual Property, Data Security, Transparency and Standardization,
Reliability, Equity and Accessibility, Data Preservation, and Avoiding
Bias and Discrimination can constitute a valuable set of considerations
to adopt throughout the digital data lifecycle.</p>
<p>In the realm of digital humanities and beyond, <strong>FAIR</strong>
and <strong>CARE</strong> principles can guide data creators,
stakeholders, and publishers in effectively managing ethical data within
the Open Data movement. If you’re interested in learning more about the

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Over the past few decades, there has been a growing discourse
surrounding the repatriation and restitution of objects as part of
efforts to decolonise and democratise research and practice in the
heritage domain.</p>
<p>Several policy documents exist at both national and international
levels to guide organisations regarding repatriation requests, dialogue,
and the practical steps involved in examining and deciding upon such
requests. While these documents primarily focus on the restitution of
physical artefacts, they also address the digital data and media
accompanying physical assets in collections.</p>
<p>For instance, the <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/supporting-arts-museums-and-libraries/supporting-collections-and-cultural-property/restitution-and-repatriation-practical-guide-museums-england" class="external-link">Restitution
and Repatriation: A Practical Guide for Museums</a> in England by the
Arts Council (2023) emphasises the importance of collection information
being accessible and transparent by ensuring that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data include comprehensive information about the
<strong>provenance</strong> of collection items, even if they reveal a
controversial past.</li>
<li>Data provide information about the <strong>historical
context</strong>, including how and why items were removed from
individuals or communities of origin, and what this reveals about the
attitudes of those involved.</li>
<li>Records are <strong>updated</strong> with newly discovered
information and are <strong>accessible</strong> to anyone interested in
learning more about a museum object or its history.</li>
<li>Visualisations such as photos and 3D scans are published in an
<strong>easily searchable</strong> format on the organisation’s website,
ensuring that the format is <strong>accessible</strong> across multiple
devices, applications, and platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, visualisations might have to be kept confidential if there are
requests from claimants or for compliance with legal obligations
regarding data protection and databases. Access rights might also have
to change based on decision outcomes about the objects of interest. The
discussion around <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2023/03/08/digital-shadows-what-happens-to-an-artefacts-data-after-it-is-restituted" class="external-link">digital
repatriation</a> and whether digital data should be kept or returned to
claimants is also another interesting aspect of this discussion.</p>
<p>The growing interest in the replication of heritage assets through
digital fabrication technologies, including 3D printing, is also
relevant to repatriation. Several examples of the deployment of this
technology in repatriation efforts are described <a href="https://theconversation.com/3d-printing-is-helping-museums-in-repatriation-and-decolonisation-efforts-126449" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p>When thinking about physical replication for repatriation purposes,
several key considerations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced technological methods can promote discussions on
decolonisation and repatriation and should not be regarded as solutions
per se.</li>
<li>Collaboration among cultural heritage institutions, initiative
groups, and communities is crucial to enable replication and
repatriation.</li>
<li>Decisions on technology, data sovereignty, access, and
replica/object ownership require mutual agreement.</li>
<li>Diverse perspectives and priorities of communities must be
recognised (i.e., reason for repatriation, meaning of object).</li>
<li>A case-by-case examination is essential, as some communities
prioritise making processes or spiritual meaning over originality.</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The term <strong>human remains</strong> is used to mean the bodies,
and parts of bodies, of once living people from the species Homo sapiens
(defined as individuals who fall within the range of anatomical forms
known today and in the recent past). This includes osteological material
(whole or part skeletons, individual bones or fragments of bone and
teeth), soft tissue including organs and skin, embryos and slide
preparations of human tissue. (DCMS, 2005)</p>

</div>
</figure><p>Please note that the term human remains seems the most popular in
literature and policy documents, yet voices are expressing a scepticism
or opposition to the term. Some parties have proposed other terms, such
as ancestral body or physical evidence of an ancestor (HAD, 2021)</p>
<p>Human remains have long been kept in heritage collections, valued for
their contribution to research, education, and the dissemination of
knowledge. Studying human remains provides valuable insights into
various aspects of history, culture, and biology. From exploring the
mysteries of human evolution to understanding past population dynamics
and health conditions, such research establishes a direct connection to
our ancestors and their lifestyles. This not only enhances our
comprehension of the past but also informs contemporary discussions on
topics such as health, medicine, and cultural diversity.</p>
<p>The collection, research, study and display of human remains in the
UK is guided by governmental and sectorial policy documents, such as the
<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/30/contents" class="external-link">Human
Tissue Act</a> (2004), <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5f291770e90e0732e4bd8b76/GuidanceHumanRemains11Oct.pdf" class="external-link">Guidance
for the Care of Human Remains in Museums</a> (2005) by the DCMS, the <a href="https://apabe.archaeologyuk.org/pdf/APABE_ToHREfCBG_FINAL_WEB.pdf" class="external-link">Guidance

Code of Ethics for Natural History Museums</a> (2013), and the <a href="https://icom.museum/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ICOM-code-En-web.pdf" class="external-link">ICOM
Code of Ethics for Museums</a> (2004). Such documents also provide
guidance about the return of human remains when such requests exist.</p>
<p>Most guidance on managing human remains via ethical practices
emphasises the need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Securely acquire and house <strong>collections</strong> with
human remains and sacred items, respecting professional standards and
relevant community beliefs.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct <strong>research</strong> on these collections with
professional standards and consideration for community beliefs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Display</strong> collections with sensitivity to
community beliefs and dignity, adhering to professional
standards.</p></li>
<li><p>Handle requests for <strong>removal or return</strong> of such
items promptly and respectfully, with clear museum policies in
place.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With the advancement of powerful and accessible digitisation methods,
along with the capacity to visualise data, including representations of
human remains, a new dimension is introduced to this discussion.
However, there is currently no specific guidance available to address
issues related to digitising human remains and managing such digital
data. Therefore, the examination and dissemination of digital data about
human remains must adhere to the ethical guidance outlined above.</p>
<p>Within this frame, some museums have chosen not to exhibit human
remains or images of remains to the public. For instance, the Pitt
Rivers Museum in Oxford not only <a href="https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/human-remains-pitt-rivers-museum-university-oxford" class="external-link">removed
all human remains from the museum displays</a> in 2020, but also
disabled access to visualisations of digitised human remains through its
online database. These are now available per request and full lists
(only with text) of human remains in the museum’s collection are
published in pdf format. In this way, the museum aims to facilitate
dialogue with communities to decide about the future care or return of
remains.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Under the current concerns about climate change and the escalating
volume of data, alongside the emergence of AI applications for data
management, there is a growing dialogue on environmental responsibility.
In the context of digital data, being environmentally responsible
involves managing digital information in a way that minimises its
negative impact on the environment while ensuring long-term preservation
and access.</p>

</figure><p>The main environmental impacts arising from digital activity in the
cultural heritage domain and beyond include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Energy consumption</strong>: Infrastructure, including
data centres, servers, networks, and end-user devices, requires
significant amounts of energy to operate. This energy consumption comes
from the continuous need for electricity to power and cool these
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Carbon emissions</strong>: The majority of the world’s
electricity still comes from fossil fuel sources such as coal, oil, and
natural gas. When infrastructure relies on electricity generated from
these sources, it results in carbon emissions, which contribute to
global warming and climate change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manufacturing and disposal</strong>: The production,
distribution, and disposal of equipment also contribute to climate
change. The manufacturing process requires energy and raw materials, and
the disposal of electronic waste (e-waste) can lead to environmental
pollution if not managed properly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Internet usage</strong>: The increasing demand for
internet services, streaming media, cloud computing, and data storage
contributes to the overall energy consumption of communication
technology infrastructure. Data centres, in particular, consume vast
amounts of energy to process and store data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Digitisation</strong>: While it has the potential to
enable more efficient and sustainable practices in various heritage
management processes, the overall increase in digitisation can lead to a
net increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions if not managed
carefully.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, there is a lack of established guidance to direct
decisions and actions toward sustainability goals for digital data
management. However, ongoing efforts exist to evaluate the environmental
impact of digital activity in the heritage domain and suggest
appropriate measures to enhance environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Some of these efforts include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/" class="external-link">Digital
Humanities Climate Coalition Toolkit</a> which aims to help researchers
and practitioners to adapt working practices to become more
environmentally responsible. The toolkit includes general guidance about
hardware, software, data storage, content management systems, use of
video and images, the use of AI, as well as grant writing, travelling to
work and more.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/6451499" class="external-link">Researcher Guide
to Writing a Climate Justice-Oriented Data Management Plan</a> which has
been published by the same initiative to support with data management
planning from a climate justice perspective.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further guidance by the Digital Heritage Hub provides advice on how
to make <a href="https://www.culturehive.co.uk/digital-heritage-hub/resource/engagement/make-your-digital-engagement-activities-better-for-the-environment/#what-next" class="external-link">digital

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Participatory approaches to planning, acquiring, curating and
publishing data have been gaining interest and have been adopted by
individuals and organisations to overcome ethical considerations and
become more inclusive. Participatory research involves collaborative
efforts where individuals affected by the research are actively engaged
in planning, acquiring, curating and publishing data. Participatory
research aims to promote social justice by ensuring that all voices are
heard and respected throughout the research process.</p>

</figure><p>While participatory efforts can greatly benefit processes around data
throughout their lifecycle, it is important to overcome potential
difficulties when working with communities and digital data. Such
obstacles might be related to power dynamics, cultural reasons, hidden
biases, conflicting individual and community interests, confidentiality
in difficult contexts and more.</p>
<p>To leverage participatory approaches when working with data in
collaboration with communities, researchers and practitioners
should:<br>
- Ensuring participants or their representatives have the autonomy to
make <strong>informed decisions</strong> about their involvement in
research and treating them with <strong>dignity</strong> throughout the
research process.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Safeguarding the <strong>well-being</strong> of research
participants or communities, minimising potential harm during the
research process.</p></li>
<li><p>Upholding principles of <strong>fairness</strong> by equitably
distributing the costs and benefits of research, allowing participants
access to its outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledging the responsibility of researchers to maintain
confidentiality, act on matters concerning participant
<strong>welfare</strong> or <strong>public safety</strong>, and disclose
relevant information transparently.</p></li>
<li><p>Committing to <strong>transparent communication</strong> by
openly discussing the research purpose and presenting findings
truthfully in analysis, presentation, and publication.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring research contributes <strong>positively to
society</strong> by advancing human knowledge and promoting
well-being.</p></li>
